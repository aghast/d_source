This is the d_source file wizard for the Code::Blocks IDE. This code 
implements a "D source" option in the "New File" dialog box that pops up
when you press Ctrl+N in the IDE.
 
Presently, the wizard.script sets the file to have a comment and license
block that is hard-coded. You can change it by editing the script 
(assign the copyright to yourself, please!). 
 
Sadly, the "default code" feature of the Settings > Editor menu is specific 
only to C and C++, and requires a recompile of the C::B sources to change.
If you'd like to help, see about making that code more flexible.
